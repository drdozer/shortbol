# Shortbol

Shortbol is a scripting language.
It was designed for SBOL but can be used for any semantic web applications as a powerful alternative to turtle.

The shortbol tools provide a complete pipeline to go from a shortbol script to xml-rdf that can then be used in any semantic web tool.


# Example web site

There is a proof-of concept website powered by shortbol, with a [tutorial](http://shortbol.ico2s.org/tutorial.html)
 where you can learn shorthand,
and a [sandbox](http://shortbol.ico2s.org/sandbox.html) where you can type in your own shorthand scripts and see them evaluated.

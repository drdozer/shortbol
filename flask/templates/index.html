<h1>What is ShortBOL?</h1>
<p>
ShortBOL is a shorthand language for SBOL that makes writing synthetic designs natural and easy. It is concise and easy to read/write and does not limit the functionality that SBOL already provides.
</p>
<p>
    ShortBOL is developed and maintained by Turing Ate My Hamster LTD and Christopher P D Taylor in partnership with Newcastle University.
